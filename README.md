## The way I Jupyter in class

I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) together with many extensions within VS Code for Jupyter Notebooks and Python.

For Python, the extensions I use are 
- [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
- [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance)
  
For Jupyter Notebooks, the extensions I use are 
- [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)
- [Jupyter Notebook Renderers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter-renderers)

I also use [Rainbox CSV](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mechatroner.rainbow-csv) for viewing CSV files.
