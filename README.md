## Binder

<a target="_blank" href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/joshmaglione/CS102-Jupyter/HEAD">
  <img src="https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg" alt="Binder"/>
</a>

Launches this repository in a Jupyter Notebook in your browser. Binder takes a while to start up (a few minutes). This way you do not have to install anything on your computer.

## Colab

<a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/joshmaglione/CS102-Jupyter">
  <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/>
</a> 

Launches the Jupyter notebooks in your browser using Google's Colab server. I believe you need a Google account to run Colab, so use [Binder](#binder) if you do not want to use or create a Google account. A Google account is *not* necessary for the module.

## The way I Jupyter in class

I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) together with many extensions within VS Code for Jupyter Notebooks and Python. There is also [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) for those that would prefer to use the version not distributed by Microsoft.

For Python, the extensions I use are 
- [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
- [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance)
  
For Jupyter Notebooks, the extensions I use are 
- [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)
- [Jupyter Notebook Renderers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter-renderers)

I also use [Rainbox CSV](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mechatroner.rainbow-csv) for viewing CSV files.
